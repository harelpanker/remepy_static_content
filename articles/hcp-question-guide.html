            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Getting a diagnosis of TGCT can feel confusing or scary,
              especially since it is a rare condition many people have never
              heard of before. This question guide is designed to help you feel
              more informed and prepared for appointments, so you can take an
              active role in conversations with your healthcare providers. It is
              okay to ask questions, ask for acronyms to be explained, and
              request that information is repeated in simpler terms until it
              feels clear and relevant to you.
