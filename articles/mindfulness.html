              There is this small, almost invisible moment that happens before
              you react.
              <br />
              A tiny pause where you actually feel what is going on inside you.
              <br />
              Mindfulness is learning how to live inside that pause a little
              more often.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not to become a Zen statue. <br />Not to silence your mind. <br />
              Just to show up for your moment with presence, kindness, and a lot
              less pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
              And the best part? <br />
              You can practice it anytime. Walking, waiting, breathing, even
              while reading an article, just like this one.
            </p>
            <h2>So what is mindfulness, really?</h2>
            <p>
              Mindfulness is the skill of purposefully paying attention to what
              is happening right now.
              <br />
              Your thoughts, your emotions, the tiny tensions in your body, the
              way a feeling shows up and fades.
              <br />
              You aim to observe it unjudgementally instead of chasing it or
              fighting it.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is the difference between reacting without thinking and
              responding with intention.
              <br />
              It is not about forcing calm.
              <br />
              It is about getting to know your inner world with a bit more
              honesty and a bit more gentleness.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
              Practice it in small moments and you may notice:
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-bottom: 0">
              <li>A clearer mind when you start spiraling</li>
              <li>A steadier body when things feel overwhelming</li>
              <li>A softer tone when you talk to yourself</li>
              <li>More choice in how you respond</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              It is not magical. It is practice. Quiet, steady, human practice.
            </p>
            <h2>Mythfulness?!</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
              Let's clear up a few myths. mindfulness is:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Not emptying your mind</li>
              <li>Not stopping thoughts</li>
              <li>Not sitting like a monk</li>
              <li>Not getting it right every time</li>
              <li>Not a quick fix</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Mindfulness is more like brushing your teeth. <br />A small daily
              habit that keeps everything a little cleaner and smoother over
              time.
            </p>
            <h2>Why mindfulness works</h2>
            <p>Because it teaches a few beautifully simple skills:</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Attention Training</strong>
              <br />You learn to notice where your mind wanders and guide it
              back without scolding yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Stepping Back from Thoughts</strong>
              <br />Thoughts become passing events, not orders. You notice them,
              you choose your response.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Emotion Regulation</strong>
              <br />Naming a feeling takes some of the bite out of it. It
              becomes something you can hold rather than something that holds
              you.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Body Awareness</strong>
              <br />You get better at noticing tension, fatigue, and early signs
              of overwhelm. This helps you pace yourself instead of crashing
              later.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is not always pleasant. <br />Sometimes your mind is noisy,
              your body is restless, and your patience is on vacation. <br />But
              you keep showing up, and over time the ground feels steadier.
            </p>
            <h2>Why might mindfulness be helpful to you?</h2>
            <p>
              Living with pain or uncertainty can pull your attention into a
              tight loop of worry, planning, and monitoring. It makes sense. It
              is what the mind does when it tries to protect you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mindfulness offers a useful path. Not by ignoring discomfort or
              trying to push worries away, but by acknowledging them and gently
              softening our struggle with them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cultivating mindfulness might help us become more gently aware and
              connected to the body, rather than operating on automatic pilot.
            </p>
            <p>
              This embodied awareness allows us to notice fluctuations in
              energy, fatigue, or pain as they arise, and to respond to them
              with greater discernment and self-compassion. In the context of
              TGCT, where energy levels and physical symptoms can change
              unpredictably, mindfulness supports more attentive, flexible, and
              effective self-regulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              For some people, it is a practical tool: noticing when the mind
              spirals, stepping back from unhelpful thoughts, and returning to a
              stable anchor like the breath or the body.
            </p>
            <p>
              For others, it is the emotional tone: less self-criticism, more
              self-compassion, letting feelings show up without treating them as
              emergencies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mindfulness will not erase difficulty. But it can change the way
              you move through it. <br />A moment of awareness. A softer breath.
              A more patient inner voice.
            </p>
            <p>
              These are small shifts, but they add up. They make pacing easier.
              They make rest possible. They help keep you connected to what
              truly matters, instead of getting lost in what hurts or worries
              you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mindfulness is not about feeling calm all the time. <br />It is
              about feeling capable. Able to meet your day with presence and
              care, even when things are not simple.
