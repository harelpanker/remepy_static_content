              Eating well matters not just during recovery, but throughout
              everyday life as well. After surgery, it may help your body regain
              strength and energy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Good nutrition plays an important role in supporting your body's
              natural recovery processes.

                >Always follow your healthcare team's guidance for your

            <h2>Protein - Your Recovery Building Block</h2>
            <p>
              Protein has the ability to support the body's natural repair and
              maintenance functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              After surgery, your body may need slightly more protein to help
              maintain muscle and strength.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aiming for balanced meals that include both protein and enough
              calories can support nourishment.

            <p>Changes in appetite or digestion are common after surgery.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                If your appetite is low: consider trying cool or cold foods,
                drink tea or diet ginger ale, and eat small, frequent meals.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you feel constipated: consider including fiber-rich foods and
                drink plenty of fluids.
              </li>
              <li>

                and smaller portions more often.
